{\bf \Huge Abstract}

  \end{center}
\vspace{1cm}

Nowadays, in a more and more technological world, it is very common that applications designed to satisfy society$'$s needs in different ambits, such as health, education or leisure appear.
With our project we decided to focus on leisure$'$s ambit and, more concretely, in the cinema$'$s world.

  Our application comes up from the need of those people who want to watch a movie accompanied, since few people nowadays decide to go to the cinema alone and we can agree that the majority of people prefer to watch a movie in company.
To answer this, our application allows the creation of plans to go watch a certain movie with friends or even people who have a similar taste. Also, it is possible that an user doesn$'$t know what movie he wants to see, so that the application will be capable of recommending the users movies that
suit their tastes.

  What is more important about our application is the ease with which an user can interact with the films and the users. With this we mean that, thanks to augmented reality, we will be able to recognize with our device$'$s camera movie posters and it even
allows facial recognition of users, so we can obtain explications about what we are recognizing in real time and so be able to interact with it through augmented reality.
