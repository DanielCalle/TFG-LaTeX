{\bf \Huge Abstract}

  \end{center}
\vspace{1cm}

We have developed a mobile application with which you can
 recognize movie posters and the faces of users for more
 information in real time and interact with it, all this
 through Augmented Reality (AR).

For the films we recognize, in addition to the information
 we can see with RA stories such as their trailer or
 assessment, we will also be able to save and view such
 information when asked and / or create plans to go to the
 movies with our friends.

Recommendation systems for users to join planes related to
their tastes or suggest films related to them.

So users can see them as friends and see information about
them through RA.
