{\bf \Huge Abstract}

  \end{center}
\vspace{1cm}

We have developed a mobile phone application with which we can 
identify different movie posters to obtain information in real time about 
them using Augmented Reality, such as the movie trailer or its rating. Also,
we include the posibility to save this information or to include the film in a plan,
for its later visualization regarding the recommendation that the application gives us based
on the tastes of the users that are inside of a plan and the movies that have been 
added. We have also made a little example of facial recognition of other users to observar,
through Augmented Reality, information of their tastes or about films they have seen previously.
