\begin{flushleft}
When the idea of this project was suggested we observed that, as it$'$s name indicates, the
domain of the project is leisure, in particular the world of cinema. It came up from the need of 
the people who wanted to watch a movie accompanied by someone, either by friends or by someone who has
a similar taste, being the affinity of people to certain film a relevant characteristic at the time of making
a decision. With this we want to reflect that anyone who has a certain degree of cinephilia could be interested
in our idea. Therefore, to answer this need we$'$ve developed a mobile application with which we can recognize movie
posters and images of user$'$s faces, to see related real time information and to be able to interact with it through 
Augmented Reality (AR). We will be able to create plans to go watch a movie with other users of the application and it 
will also recommend plans with a movie related to their tastes.
