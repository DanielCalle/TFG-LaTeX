{\bf \Huge Abstract}

  \end{center}
\vspace{1cm}
\begin{flushleft}
We have developed a mobile application with which you can
 recognize movie posters and images of faces of users to see more
 information in real time and interact with it, all this is done
 through Augmented Reality (AR).

For the films we recognize, in addition to the information
 we can see with AR such as their trailer or
 valoration, we will also be able to save and view such
 information when we want and / or create plans to go to the
 cinema with our friends.

We use recommendation systems so the users of the application can join plans related to
their tastes or suggest them films which they have an affinity with.

We can also add other users as friends and see information about
them through AR.
